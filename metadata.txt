description=Interactively find shortest path between points over a line network and calculate the Fiber Loss Budget of a fiber optic network (backbone or FTTH)

about=The "On-the-Fly Shortest Path" plugin offers an interactive measurement of distances along a line network, operating directly on the map. It calculates Distance and the Fiber Loss Budget in fiber optic networks. The plugin uses the core Network Analysis library of QGIS in order to calculate the shortest path via the Dijkstra algorithm. Subsequently, it calculates the fiber loss of this path, considering several configured parameters (connector loss, splice loss, fiber attenuation, splitters etc.). In contrast to similar algorithms of the Processing toolbox, this plugin does not create a new layer for every measurement but rather presents the path and the calculated parameters directly on screen. This functionality is similar to the original RoadGraph plugin of QGIS2. On top of this, it allows the setting of an optional middle point, forcing the path to cross this. This is helpful in networks with multiple paths between the start and stop point.

changelog=1.0.0:
          - First experimental release
            Known issues:
              * The plugin supports only the English language.
           1.0.1
              * Added explicit casting to QgsPointXY object, because it produced error on Linux
           1.0.2
              * Enhanced functionality for Middle button
              * Support for point tool loose and regaining focus
              * Created rubberband list and modified rubberband functionality to allow code to operate massively on rubberbands, regardless of their number.
              * Beautified the measurement of off-graph lines
              * Added update of rubberband attributes on canvas after a configuration change
              * Changed calculation CRS to be made on project CRS rather than layer CRS, to allow 'on the fly' CRS transformations, as well as measurements with different CRS and ellipsoid.
            1.0.3
              * Changed the rubberband engine to cope with dynamicaly assigned points. Removed static rb1, rb2
            1.0.4
              * Added distance units conversion
              * Added selection to exclude entry and exit cost
              * Renamed variables sourceCrs to avoid confusion with same name methods
              * Added example shapefile
              * Changes logo icon with a simpler one
            1.0.5
              * Added check for unit conversion if base unit is not meters
              * Added selection of CRS for measurements
              * Added new results window without fiber loss data.
